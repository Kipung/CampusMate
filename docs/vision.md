# CampusMate Vision

CampusMate is a mobile-first web application designed to connect university students for collaborative study. It addresses the common challenge of finding compatible study partners by intelligently matching users based on their courses, study habits, and availability. 

The platform facilitates the formation of effective study groups, both online and in-person, fostering a supportive academic community. By leveraging technology to create meaningful academic connections, CampusMate aims to enhance the learning experience, improve academic performance, and reduce the isolation often felt by students.
